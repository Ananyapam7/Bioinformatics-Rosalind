# Rosalind
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. 

Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.
Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity. 

By the way, the project's name commemorates Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography with Raymond Gosling facilitated the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems.
